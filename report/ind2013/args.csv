A185001345000000022_0,185001345000000022,"I am concerned about the criminalization of artificial intelligence (AI) as a strict liability offense. AI plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives, and its development continues to advance. However, if AI is used for illegal activities, it is unfair to solely burden the victims with responsibility. Criminalizing AI and attributing liability as a strict liability offense to individuals could impose undue burdens on many people. For instance, to sue the companies or individuals who developed AI, collecting evidence and the costs and time involved in pursuing legal action would be necessary. As a result, only some individuals or companies may afford to file lawsuits, while many victims may not receive redress. I believe that those responsible for AI involvement in illegal activities should be held accountable, but the responsibility should be shared equally. Not only should the victims be the ones to initiate legal action, but related companies and institutions should also bear the responsibility of taking appropriate measures. When laws regarding AI's involvement in illegal activities are discussed, it is crucial to advocate for the protection of victims' rights and the establishment of a fair system. Instead of leaving the handling of illegal activities to individual victims, we should establish a legal framework and allocate responsibilities appropriately to implement fair and effective measures."

AI used for generating illustrations may not only learn from illustrations but also from images available online. Some AI systems have been found to contain images of child pornography and images of sexual abuse victims among the data used for training. It is important to understand the potential harm caused by such images being generated by AI software and the abnormality of promoting the use of such software for immediate gains, disregarding the dignity of one's children or acquaintances.

Furthermore, as the issues related to AI-generated content are not limited to Japan but can have global implications, it is best to ensure that these issues can have an impact internationally. Concrete discussions on the copyright of AI-generated content will only be possible once legislation is in place to regulate AI systems that use data in violation of laws and ethics, thereby maintaining a healthy environment. Until then, copyright should not be granted uniformly to AI-generated content, as the rights holders of the data used for training are continuously being infringed upon. Regarding copyright infringement of images generated by AI, illustrators often have a distinct style that can be easily recognized by those familiar with their work. Therefore, creators may have themes or expressions they avoid in their work to protect their public image. However, AI may output images that include themes or expressions the creator would never incorporate. This can lead to damages for creators who receive requests from clients seeking to avoid themes like sexual or violent content. It is crucial to regulate this issue promptly."

A185001345000001983_0,185001345000001983,"Before considering the issues of AI and copyright, we need to understand the fundamental principles on which basic human rights, democracy, and a free society are built."
A185001345000001983_1,185001345000001983,"Democracy and a free society are based on the principle of personal identity, where 'my face and my voice belong to me'. However, the ability of AI to create deepfakes allows 'my face and my voice' to be used by others, leading to the loss of individual rights and societal inability to hold individuals accountable. Assigning rights and responsibilities to individuals is fundamental to democracy and a free society, and neglecting the implications of AI creation poses a threat to the rule of law and order."
A185001345000001983_2,185001345000001983,It is essential to consider the concept of 'my face and my voice belong to me' as the fundamental principle underlying the rights and responsibilities of a democratic society when discussing intellectual property.
A185001345000001983_3,185001345000001983,"From a perspective of responsibility rather than rights, how do we define the creations of AI? When a specific individual publishes a creation and it is found to be illegal, that individual bears the responsibility and consequences. However, if an AI creation is found to be illegal, do you believe the AI should bear responsibility? The argument that 'AI learning is the same as human learning' by proponents of AI development is fallacious. AI learning and creation are merely mechanical reproductions of calculations and are fundamentally different from learning and creation tied to human physiology and existence. It is the connection to an individual's physiology and existence that grants individuals rights and protections from society. Instead of granting rights and responsibilities to AI for its learning and creation, it should be the humans utilizing AI who bear the rights and responsibilities. AI is simply a tool."
A185001345000001983_4,185001345000001983,"Therefore, the notion of 'unauthorized AI learning is permissible without penalties' is unacceptable. When using AI creations, all unauthorized learning should be prohibited, and disclosure of the learning content during creation is necessary. Subsequently, both the individual who taught the AI and the AI itself should bear rights and responsibilities for the created content."
A185001345000001983_5,185001345000001983,"The argument that 'unpublished learning is not illegal' no longer holds significance in the current landscape surrounding AI creations. However, a discussion on the restriction of 'learning without reflecting the content in the creation' may be feasible with certain AI creations. Such AI creations would likely operate on principles distinct from current deep learning machine methods for AI creation."
