A185001345000000022_0,185001345000000022,"I am concerned about the criminalization of artificial intelligence (AI) as a strict liability offense. AI plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives and its development continues to advance. However, if AI is used for illegal activities, it is unfair to solely burden the victims with responsibility. Criminalizing AI and attributing liability as a strict liability offense to individuals could impose undue burdens on many. For instance, to sue the companies or individuals who developed AI, gathering evidence and the costs and time involved in legal proceedings would be necessary. As a result, only some individuals or companies may afford to file lawsuits, while many victims may not receive redress. I believe that those responsible for AI involvement in illegal activities should be held accountable, but the responsibility should be shared equally. Not only should victims be the entities to initiate lawsuits, but related companies and institutions should also bear the responsibility of taking appropriate measures. When laws regarding AI's involvement in illegal activities are discussed, it is crucial to strongly advocate for protecting the rights of victims and establishing a fair system. Instead of leaving the handling of illegal activities to individual victims, we should establish a legal framework and allocate appropriate responsibilities to implement fair and effective measures."
